# PassClock
PassClock â€“ University Thesis Project
This repository contains the full documentation and source materials for PassClock, a mobile application developed as part of a university thesis in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The project focuses on the digitalization of maintenance workflows for small and medium-sized enterprises, leveraging Flutter for cross-platform development and Firebase for real-time data synchronization.
The thesis follows a User-Centered Design (UCD) methodology, incorporating interviews, low/high-fidelity prototypes, usability tests, and iterative feedback to ensure a functional, accessible, and scalable solution.
The project includes design documentation, user scenarios, interface mockups, and usability evaluation results.
